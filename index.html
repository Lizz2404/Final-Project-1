      <p>Hello, it's a pleasure to meet you! To begin, I consider myself an artist at heart. I enjoy drawing, painting, sculpting, and writing in my free time. My artistic journey began in childhood, with my earliest canvases being the walls of my bedroom. From a young age, I always aspired to have a career that allowed me to be creative. I was the kid in kindergarten who said they wanted to be an artist when they grew up. Throughout my young years, I always debated what kind of artist I would become. I thought that one day I was going to become an artist that flew around the world painting murals. Another year, I thought I'd become like Takashi Murakami and create one design that would explode and make millions. Another time, I thought I could become an animator working with the likes of Disney or Studio Ghibli. In today's world, art is everywhere, so finding where and how my artistic abilities would fit was hard, and I'm still figuring it out since the world is constantly changing. For now, I'm passionate about designing and creating online spaces.</p>
